# What is Purr?

Purr is a programming environment that aims to realise a very specific view of "programming". And this view is influenced by many non-conventional fields, such as sociology. As well as conventional ones, such as mathematics.

When people talk about "views of programming" they tend to mean something like models of computation (e.g.: Functional Programming is a view of programs as a mathematical pursuit, in a way that helps reasoning about programs statically), or an approach to programming (e.g.: programming in industry is more interested in practical tools to tackle problems than in mathematical consistency).

In a sense, Purr is closer to a new approach to programming. This approach is guided by the following principle:

> ‚ÄúWe should be able to collaborate with computers in the same way we do with humans.‚Äù

As a view of programming, Purr has a focus on collaboration. When people talk about collaboration, they generally mean helping humans get work done together. That's a very good start. Purr aims to extend that view of collaboration to include computing systems as well. Purr's approach to programming is focused on making practical the process of collaboration among all of these different actors, computers and humans alike. 

Collaboration involves two very important principles:

  - Rich interaction and feedback; and
  - Trust;

We'll discuss this in more details in the following sections.


## Rich interaction and feedback

Programming language design seems, largely, to be driven through the necessities in computing systems and mathematical models. Now, this isn't a bad thing. Those are certainly two things that every reasonable programming language *should* be considering in their design. But programming is as much about humans as it is about those.

The human aspect of programming language design seems to be often neglected. There are very few empirical studies on the usability of programming languages, whereas we have no shortage of studies proving mathematical properties about the latest features (these days, probably gradual typing and effect systems).

Purr proposes that not only we take human usability into account, but we look at systems of people as an inspiration for programming languages, too. In particular, we look at how people work together both when physically in the same location, and remote. Collaboration is shaped by the available tools, and the collaboration enabled by being physically in the same location is still much richer today.

How exactly is this collaboration "rich", though?

Humans use a myriad of forms of communication and medium depending on what the context asks for. We use different pitch and tone of voice to convey information and emphasis. We get physical with the things we're manipulating. We present the same information in different formats. When someone doesn't understand something, we can work *with* them to build an understanding. 

Meanwhile, programming computers is more akin to writing letters. And to someone who'll yell "NO" at you every time your writing differs from the normative grammar. Or when you write something confusing or ambiguous. It's amazing that we have these very rich display devices, touch inputs, and even augmented reality with motion sensors... but the state-of-the-art of programming is still typing and looking at text in 70's terminal emulators.
