# What is Purr?

Purr is a programming environment that aims to realise a very specific view of "programming". There are many different schools of thought of how "programming" should be done. Some see programming as a mathematical pursuit, and thus being able to statically reason about programs, and embed proofs of a program's properties are the important part. Others see programming as a more practical activity, where one is interested primarily in programming as a means to solve problems, regardless of its mathematical consistency. Some yet see programming as a creative outlet, not necessarily meant to solve anything.

Purr is neither of these exactly, but it's a view based on the following principle: we should be able to collaborate with computers in the same way we do with humans. It's more about the process than the goals--the process may be applied to any of the above goals. But the _process_ is the more important part. Purr is about how you approach programming.

We can outline the following ideas that contribute to this process:

- Immediate feedback;
- Managing trust;

## Immediate feedback

Purr proposes an idea of programming in a "conversational" style. Commonly, programming is more like sending e-mails. You write everything you need to say, you hit send, and then, after some time interpreting the e-mail, you might get a reply, which will go through the same process.

Meanwhile, while we're talking to someone, we have a much quicker feedback loop. We convey messages through many means (words, sounds, body language, etc), and our partner is an active part of the conversation, reacting to our messages in real time.

Programming is an activity that could really benefit from a more conversational style: to have a richer way of conveying messages and reactions, and to shorten the feedback loop. For example, as we write a program, the computer may display the effects right away. We may use richer representations of programs and feedback (for example, graphs and images).


## Managing trust

When we talk to people in our daily lives, we don't place the same amount of trust in them. The amount of information we choose to share (and how we share it) differs greatly from when we're talking with a close friend to when we're talking to a work acquaintance. Yet, in programming, we're generally forced to place the same levels of trust in everyone.

Sometimes, we're allowed to manage trust in programming through identity. However, such identity is not very fine grained. We can't (usually) manage different trust levels when talking to Alissa at work and talking to Alissa while hanging out at her place in the weekend (because she invited you to a bbq her wife decided to throw out of the blue). But, worse, we (usually) can't even manage different trust levels when talking to Alissa and when talking to Max. We have to place them in some arbitrary category (say "friends"), and pretend the experience, context, trust, relationship, etc. are the same for all of them, all the time.
